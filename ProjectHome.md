The Connected Chemistry project was initiated by Mike Stieff, PhD, now at the University of Illinois at Chicago. These simulations are the interactive component of this curriculum.

Simulations were initially designed by Allan Berry, according to instructions from users and the rest of the Connected Chemistry team; Tuan Dang and Qin Li have since assumed most development.
